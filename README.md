The program is a realization of the laboratory assignments for DH2642 Interaction Programming and Dynamic Web course at Kungliga Tekniska HÃ¶gskolan (Stockholm), done in collaboration with Saga Harnesk.

The work was aimed at learning the fundamentals of JavaScript, REST APIs, HTML with CSS. The application implements Model-View-Control architecture, with event-driven code.

The resulting Dinnerplanner app fetches and displays dishes info from spoonacular API, facilitates the creation of custom menu, provides an overview and print view of the chosen meals. Mobile layout of the app is available and cookies are supported (with localStorage).
